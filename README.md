# 🏋️‍♂️ AI-Powered Fitness Application (Backend)

In today's fast-paced world, maintaining fitness can be a challenge. This AI-powered fitness application aims to provide users with intelligent tracking and personalized recommendations to help them achieve their health goals. This repository contains the backend implementation, developed using a **Spring Boot microservices architecture** to ensure scalability, resilience, and ease of maintenance. The application leverages modern technologies like Keycloak for robust security, RabbitMQ for efficient asynchronous communication, and the Google Gemini API for intelligent fitness insights.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ **User Authentication & Authorization** using **Keycloak**: Securely manages user access and permissions.
- 🏃 **Fitness Activity Tracking** (Steps, Calories, Workout Duration): Comprehensive logging of user activities.
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Recommendations** using **Google Gemini**: Delivers personalized workout and nutrition suggestions based on user data.
- 📨 **Asynchronous Communication** via **RabbitMQ**: Ensures efficient, decoupled communication between services for real-time updates and notifications.
- 🔒 **Secure REST APIs** with **Spring Security**: Protects all endpoints with industry-standard security practices.
- ⚙️ **Microservice Architecture** for scalability and maintainability: Each core function is developed as an independent service, allowing for easier development, deployment, and scaling.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   **Java 17 or higher**: The runtime environment for Spring Boot applications.
-   **Maven 3.6+**: For building and managing project dependencies.
-   **Docker**: Essential for easily running RabbitMQ and optionally Keycloak.
-   **Google Gemini API Key**: Required for the AI-powered recommendation service.

### 🔧 Setup Instructions

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YOUR_USERNAME]/AI-PoweredFitnessApplication.git
cd AI-PoweredFitnessApplication
2. Start RabbitMQ in Docker
Bash

docker run -d --hostname rabbitmq --name rabbitmq \
  -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management
This command starts a RabbitMQ container with the management plugin enabled, accessible via http://localhost:15672.

3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project, or configure these variables directly in your IDE's run configurations:

GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=[YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY]
KEYCLOAK_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080
RABBITMQ_HOST=localhost
4. Build and Run Each Service
Navigate to each service directory and use Maven to start them. You will need to run each service in a separate terminal window or process.

Bash

cd activity-service
mvn spring-boot:run
Repeat for each of the following:

auth-service

ai-service

notification-service

📬 API Overview
Auth Service
POST /auth/register – Register a new user account.

POST /auth/login – Authenticate and retrieve an access token for subsequent API calls.

Activity Service
POST /activities/add – Add a new fitness activity record (e.g., steps, calories burned, workout duration).

GET /activities/user/{userId} – Retrieve all activity logs for a specific user.

AI Service
POST /ai/suggestions – Generate personalized workout suggestions or nutritional advice based on user data.

Notification Service
This service primarily functions as a RabbitMQ listener for user updates and messages, enabling asynchronous processing of notifications and internal service communications.
